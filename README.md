# Architecture
This space is aimed to serve as a repository to the Architecture processes, patterns, technologies and any other useful artifacts. 

A consistent architecture can help us to prevent serious design problems and reduce effort and related costs in long term.  

Inside this documentation can be found info about different architecture aspects, that must be observed during the software development lifecycle.

A poorly designed architecture can result in a short application timespan, as can be obeserved in the picture representing the lifecycle of a poorly designed application.

In the other hand, in most cases designing applications with a proper architecture results in an extended lifecycle, in which the relationship between effort and delivery stays positive longer. This can be found at the picture Well Designed Architecture Results.
